Input to RNN

Make an array of those KeyVectors for input into RNN

I think LSTM can handle the length of our input vectors so just use one type test as one piece of
training data. If it proves to be too long and you're not getting proper accuracy refer to

1.) Make another file for writing the LSTM training data (called after finishing typeTest)
2.) Write the actual LSTM using a library
3.) Connect the LSTM to your typeTest so that it evaluates after each run
